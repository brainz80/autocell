# Cellular Automata

This is a small experiment with Cellular Automata. The idea is to generalize
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
style Cellular Automaton as a Transition Table and play with procedurally
generated Transition Tables.

## Quick Start

```console
$ npm install
$ ./node_modules/.bin/tsc
$ iexplore.exe index.html
```
